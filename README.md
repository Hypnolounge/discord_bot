# HypnoloungeBot

So here are some rules/steps to work with this repo and the environment:

## Rules
1. Always work in dev. If you are done with your changes you can create a pull request and merge into main.

## DEV Setup
1. Copy the .env.example to .env and fill it out. You will find the required values in the discord or idk somehwere
2. Connect to the vpn provided in the discord, to be able to access the db. You should keep your internet access. If not let me know. Also welcome to Germany lol
3. Now you can run the bot with npm run dev.

That would make you able to run the bot and do dev shit.

## Deployment
1. If you are done with your changes, create a pull request and merge the changes into main.
2. If setup correctly, the github repo should automatically build a new docker image and push it to docker hub.
3.
